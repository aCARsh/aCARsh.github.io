# Welcome to My Website!

Hi, I’m Akarsh Sahay!  
This is my personal website where I share my **academic journey, competitions**, and thoughts through my **blog**.

- [Academics](achievements.md)
- [The Voices in my head](blog.md) - They are never quite. After some time I realised, they are actually pretty interesting to talk to, so I have started documenting stuff that they say. Helps in having conversations as I find it hard to come up with stuff on the spot.
