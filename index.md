# Welcome to My Website!

Hi, I’m Akarsh Sahay!  
This is my personal website where I share my **academic journey, competitions**, and thoughts through my **blog**.
This is an inline image ![alt text](_images/oxf.png)<img src="_images/oxf.png" width="20" height="20"> inside text.

- [Academics](academics.md)
- [The Voices in my head](blog.md) - They never shut up. Recently I have realised, they are actually pretty interesting, so I have started documenting what they say. Helps in having conversations as I find it hard to come up with things to say on the spot. Essentially my thoughts on random things I think about before falling asleep.
