# Welcome to My Website!

Hi, I’m Akarsh Sahay! I am currently an undergraduate physics student at the University of Oxford <img src="https://acarsh.github.io/assets/oxlogo.png" width="20" height="20">  
This is my personal website where I created to document experiences I have had so far, stuff I have thought and things I have made.

- [Academics](academics.md)
- [The Voices in my head](blog.md) - They never shut up. Recently I have realised, they are actually pretty interesting, so I have started documenting what they say. Helps in having conversations as I find it hard to come up with things to say on the spot. Essentially my thoughts on random things I think about before falling asleep.
